            <br>
            <p class="main_p_info" style="text-align: justify;">
              Ladakh, often referred to as the "Land of High Passes," is also the land of deep gorges, barren mountains,
               snow capped peaks, pristine lakes, hilltop monasteries, rich culture and lovely people. Whether you are 
               a mountaineer, an adventure seeker or a culture enthusiast - Ladakh has bounties to offer to everyone. 
               Ladakh as a region is steeped in cultural traditions and diverse Buddhist religions and spiritual 
               practices. Being at a minimum altitude of 3500m, anyone visiting the place needs a certain level of physical and mental 
               fitness to appreciate it to the fullest.
            </p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <div>
            <p class="main_p_info" style="text-align: justify;">
              Ladakh's rich cultural tapestry is woven with threads of Tibetan Buddhism, reflected in its ancient 
              monasteries, vibrant festivals, and traditional arts. Monasteries such as Hemis, Thiksey, and Diskit 
              are not only places of worship but also repositories of history and art, offering a glimpse into the 
              region's spiritual heritage. The local festivals, filled with colorful costumes, mask dances, and 
              traditional music, bring the community together and provide visitors with an immersive cultural 
              experience. The art of Thangka painting and the intricate craftsmanship seen in wood carvings and 
              textiles further showcase Ladakh's cultural depth. <br>

              The people of Ladakh are renowned for their warmth and hospitality. Despite the harsh climatic conditions,
               their resilience and simplicity shine through. 
            </p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <div>
            <p class="main_p_info" style="text-align: justify;">
              Visitors are often welcomed into homes with a cup of 
               traditional butter tea  and a hearty meal, experiencing firsthand the genuine hospitality that defines 
               Ladakhi life. The traditional dress, Goncha, and the exquisite turquoise and silver jewelry worn by the
                women add to the region's unique charm. In Ladakh, the sense of community is strong, with festivals, 
                rituals, and daily activities reflecting a deep-seated bond among the people.
                <br>As many time as you visit the place, it has the potential to surprise you. The journey to Ladakh is never 
              complete, the exploration never over. And Team TBT invites you to one such journey, where we would learn 
              and explore as much as you would..

                <p>Leh palace is a massive nine storey stone structure that towers above the Leh old town. An example of
                   medieval Tibetan architecture, it has massive walls and wooden balconies. The palace served as the 
                   regal residence of Namgyal dynasty until the mid 19th century, but now lies in ruins. The panoramic 
                   view of the Leh city with the backdrop of snow capped peakas seen from the top of the palace is a 
                   sight to behold.

                  statue of Buddha, while the second level showcases various incidents from the life of Buddha. Apart 
                  from religious importance, the place offers magnificent panoramic view of Leh city, and well is a 
                  go-to place for glorious sunrise and sunsets.

                   The landscape is so unbelievable that it is rightly called moonscape. This quaint little town is just

                    many migratory birds and one of the Ramsar sites in India.<br><br>

                </div>
                  <p>Located on the banks of Indus River, Leh is the largest city in Ladakh region. Located at an 
                    altitude of 3,500m/11,500 ft, it is the largest as well as the capital city of Ladakh. The region of Ladakh lies 
                    in the rain shadow area of Himalayas, hence called the cold desert. Altitude in the region varies from 3000m to 7000m,
                    contributing to the region's extremely cold and dry environment. The air at this height is so thin that it 
                    intensifies the sun rays making it unbearably hot. One may experience both sunstroke and frostbite due to freezing 
                    winds and hot sunlight. The weather in the region is 
                    harsh, with winters seeing temperatures as low as -35 deg C in Leh city, and -45 deg C at higher altitudes.</p>
