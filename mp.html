              Ladakh - indeed a lifetime trip for adventure seekers. The rugged beauty of the place and the warmth of
              the locals shall keep calling you back. However, it's not a place for those who look for a party in the
              mountains, but for those who can follow a discipline on the trip while opening up their hearts to a new
              world.

              Ladakh, a place so explored yet unexplored, is the dream of every adventure seeker who adores some
              roughness and a lot of beauty.
              Positioned at an average elevation of more than 11000 feet, Ladakh is known to be the land of high passes.
              It's a cold mountain desert with rugged roads, clear blue skies, magnificent landscapes, postcard-perfect
              serene lakes, vast plateaus, hilltop monasteries, rustic houses, snow-clad mountain peaks, and verdant
              valleys that surprise us with a splash of vivid green patches.
              Ladakh, once used to be a part of the silk route, is also the land of high passes. It boasts of having the
              highest motorable road in the world passing through Khardung La situated at 18380 feet. It's the proud
              home to some of the highest elevated lakes in the world such as Tso Pangong and Tso Moriri situated at
              14800 feet.
            </p>

            <p class="main_p_info" style="text-align: justify;">
              Did you know that the word Juley is used for hello, tso for lake, la for pass in the Ladakhi language?
              Do you also that Tibetan Buddhism is practiced in Ladakh, and its sects and practices?
              Did you know that a major portion of Pangong Lake lies in China?
              Let's embark on a lifetime adventure to this heaven on earth, and open up our hearts to a new road while
              taking a deep breath. More than landscapes, the bright smiles and the warm hospitality of Ladakhi people
              make a visit to Ladakh an unforgettable experience, and we shall forever be haunted by the beauty of the
              prayer flags waving in the air, smiles of monks, eternal silence in the monasteries, and countless cups of
              butter tea.

                    curtains, everything is planned professionally and meticulously. We have a strong ground-level

                  <p>Transforming Travels is not just a dream of a passionate traveler who started the company, but now
                    it's also the favorite travel companion of those who don't have anyone else to travel with. It's a
                    story of how strangers became close during our trips, how a mother-daughter became friends during a
                    hike, or how a woman came out of her fears during a road trip.</p>

                <h3>Location Details</h3>
                <p>A moderately challenging trek that takes you to some of the most remote and isolated areas of Ladakh.
                  We start the trip with a day hike over Rumptse and by visting Tso Kar, a high altitude lake in the
                  Rupshu plateau. We then drive to Pang, a small settlement at roughly 4500m, from where we start our
                  trek.The area around Pang from where we start the trek is called Kiang Chu Thang in the local
                  language, which means a region where even the Kiang (Tibetan wild-ass) does not find water. But since
                  much of the trail that we take is through river valleys fed by the snows of high-passes, we get to
                  experience this unique region of Ladakh. This special trail goes through what is quintessential Ladakh
                  terrain - river valleys, vast meadows filled with a variety of shrubs, and high passes over 5000m. The
                  grand climax of the trek is a descent down to Tso Moriri Lake, one of the largest high-altitude lakes
                  in the region, offering stunning views of the surrounding landscape including 6000m peaks like Mentok
                  Kangri, Chamser Kangri and Lungser Kangri. This is an ideal trek for those looking to experience the
                  wild yet mesmerising part of Ladakh in all its glory.</p>
